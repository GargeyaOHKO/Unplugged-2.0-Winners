## Overview
The ALT_24 project features a solar panel pan-tilt mechanism that dynamically tracks the sun for optimal energy absorption. It utilizes two servo motors for horizontal (pan) and vertical (tilt) movement. The top section securely holds the solar panel, while the lower enclosure houses the PCB and electronics. This system ensures efficient solar tracking, making it ideal for automation and renewable energy applications.
